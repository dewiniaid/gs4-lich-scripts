  *** THIS SCRIPT IS EXPERIMENTAL ***

  Spellmerge condenses the effects of certain mass spells falling off (and other similar effects) to reduce screen
  scroll.

  Rather than seeing:

    <spell effect> fades from Wyrom
    <spell effect> fades from Kenstrom
    <spell effect> fades from Haliste

  You'll see

    <spell effect> fades from Wyrom, Kenstrom, and Haliste.

  This works by slightly delaying the spell messaging while it collects additional names to add to the list.  As
  such, spell effect messaging may appear slightly out-of-order from how it actually happens.

  Spell effects on you are not affected by either the delay nor the merging effect.

  This version also traps the output of GROUP, which can be used as a quick basic test of functionality.
  GROUP trapping functionality will become optional in a future release.

# Theory:
# Fast-check each incoming line to see if it contains a potential reference to a player.  If not, skip all other checks.
# Check each incoming line of XML against each pattern to see if it matches to see if it matches.
# Return if it does not

# If line matches:
# Check against hashtable of queued matches.
# If present, add to list.
# If negative, schedule.

# Scheduler events
# First component is event time.
# Second component is list of names.

#
# Check key against queue
# If found: Append name to list
# If not found: Determine expiration time, create new entry.
#
# Scheduling:
# If queue is empty before we add to the list, schedule an event DELAY seconds in the future.
# When we handle an event, the next event is the timestamp of the next entry in the queue.


# Spell merge delay, in seconds.
