	Welcome Combo Script Version 2!
	
	This script will do UCS fighting for you!
	It will start with JAB and take advantage of Tier Up opportunities.
	
	Once it has achieved Tier 3, it will always continue with your specified Tier attack.
	
	-Changelog:
		v2: 
		-Completely rewritten to include debug messages
		-Now correctly tier's up to Tier 3 instead of getting stuck in one attack
		-Will default back to jab to achieve higher Tiers if not at highest Tier.
		-Added detection of hit/miss, will continue the vulnerable attack until success
		
		v2.1:
		-Added setting of your default tier 3 attack
		
		v2.2:
		-Added waiting for RT to end, spam attacks 1 second before rt ends.
		
		v2.3:
		-Making it stop after killing one target.
		-Added tierup settings and tier3 attack settings.
		
		v2.4:
		-Added aiming
		
		v2.5:
		-Caught kicking while lying down
		-Caught stunned/webbed/generic failures
		
		v2.6:
		-Doesn't aim your jabs for faster tier up.
		
		v2.7
		-Fixed broken aiming cycling.
		
		v2.8
		-Added exiting when the target is dead (probably)
		
		v2.9
		-Damn you calm bastards
		
		v3.0
		-Added stand check
		-Added ability to specify a target
		(Alllll untested!!! So use at your own damn risk!!)
		
		v3.1
		-Changed pause to sleep for lich 4.6 update
		
		v3.2 
		-Stance option

		v3.3
			-The moment Takoa butchered this script! 
			-Direct all complaints regarding the following issues to Takoa:
			
			-Will focus mstrike using your tier3 attack when possible
			-If you have Krynch active, will try to <tier3> your <aim> location first
				if mstrike is on cooldown
			-Exits if your bigshot ALWAYS FLEE FROM or FLEE COUNT conditions are met
				if bigshot is running, ignores otherwise
			-Has a new TOOHIGH setting for aimed attacks for taller targets, will go to that
				if you get a "cannot reach" message. For instance, if you set your normal
				aim location to be "head", and your "toohigh" to be "left leg" it will
				always try to punch the head first, if you get the "too high" message it
				will then switch to the left leg. Once the head is reachable it will then
				hit that again
			-Will now only try to mstrike if you have >= 30 ranks of MOC. Noobs.
			-Fixed bug that wasn't starting attack routine when krynch not active

		v3.4
		-Now targets crap with weird names. Thank Genstealer for complaining about it.
