A fierce one-eyed man named Baron LaBonne
A meaner pirate had never been known
  And he sailed
    on the Dark Lady

!Play theo mournful 1

A ship strong and sound with a perilous crew
And high on the mast the skull and bones flew
  Fleet and swift
    was the Dark Lady

!Play theo slow 7

And every night the Baron would drink a toast
He'd say, "Here's to my lovely lady host!
My one true love..."

"Hear, hear!" the crew replied
And the Dark Lady sighed.

A rich Nalfein galleon was spotted one night
The Dark Lady's crew prepared for the fight
  Clash of swordsâ€¦
    No elf had survived it

Except for the maiden with dark eyes so bold
Found in the hull with the jewels and the gold
  LaBonne laughed
    and took her for ransom

!Play theo inspiring 2

And every night the Baron would drink a toast
He'd say, "Here's to my lovely lady host!
My one true love..."

"Hear, hear!" the crew replied
And the Dark Lady sighed.

The girl Carlotta was a beauty quite rare
With each passing night LaBonne couldn't bear
  His empty bed.
    He brought her to it.

The Baron soon found he felt more than desire
His love for her grew and his soul filled with fire
  He proclaimed
    that they would marry.

That night the Baron drank with jubilee
And said, "Here's to my lovely bride to be!
My one true love..."

"Hear, hear!" the crew replied
And the Dark Lady cried.

The following night a storm brewed at sea
The Dark Lady saw her chance to be free
  Of her rival
    the beauty Carlotta

!Play theo intense 5

The ship steered herself to the heart of the gale
Where a wave swept the maiden out over the rail
  Sweet revenge
    on an unfaithful lover.

That night the Lady drank a toast
And said, "Here's to your lovely lady host!
Your one true love..."

No voices replied
And the Dark Lady smiled.

And now any night when a storm fills the sky
They say that a ghost ship sails in its eye
  Fleet and swift
    is the Dark Lady

!Play theo mournful 7

A ship strong and sound with a perilous crew
And high on the mast the skull and bones flew
  While the captain
    gazes out to sea.

And every night the Baron must drink a toast
He says, "Here's to our lovely lady host!
My one true love..."

"Hear, hear," the ghost crew replies
And the Dark Lady smiles.
